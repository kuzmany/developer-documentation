# Marketplace

Mautic 4 comes with a Marketplace directly in the Mautic administration user interface and command line interface as well.

## Marketplace under the hood

The Marketplace use [Packagist](https://packagist.org) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) v2 under the hood. Packagist API is used to list the Mautic plugins and find the plugin details. Composer v2 is used to install and update the plugins. Composer will take care of the dependencies of your plugin and also compatibility with different Mautic, PHP and other dependecies versions.
